## Getting Started`

### 1. install the needed package:

```bash
npm i
```

### 2. Set the required environment variables:

copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and populate the required environment variables.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Not all users have access to the GPT-4 model yet. If you don't have access, you can use GPT-3 by setting `OPENAI_MODEL` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` in the `.env.local` file.

**If you want online research to work, you only need a tavily API key, which you can obtain here: https://tavily.com/**

### 3. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Zoom in on the CopilotKit code

1. Search for `useMakeCopilotReadable` to see where frontend application information is being made accessible to the Copilot engine

2. Search for `useAppendSlide` and `useUpdateSlide` to see where the frontend application action is made accessible to the Copilot engine.

3. In `route.ts`, see how the backend-running `researchAction` is defined against the `research.ts` agent, powered by LangChain's LangGraph and by Tavily research API.
